This is the first line of sample text.\\
To write a for-loop like this in plain text:
\{$ FOR i 1 10 1 $}
	This is \{$= i $}-th time this message is generated.
\{$END$}
you must write:
\\\{$ FOR i 1 10 1}
	This is \\\{$= i $}-th time this message is generated.
\\\{$END$}

The rest of the program is below this line.
{$ FOR i 1 10 1 $}
  This is {$= i $}-th time this message is generated.
{$END$}
{$FOR i 0 10 2 $}
  sin({$=i$}^2) = {$= i i * @sin "0.000" @decfmt $}
{$END$}
